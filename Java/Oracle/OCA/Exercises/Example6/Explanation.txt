First option will print a true.

Second option will print false.

Third option will not compile because Boolean class does not have a no-args constructor. Remember 
that no other wrapper class has a no-args constructor eiter. So new Integer(), or new Long() will 
also not compile.

Fourth option: Case of the String parameter does not matter. As long as the String equals "true" after ignoring 
the case, it will be parsed as true.  However, if you have extra spaces, for example, " true" or "true ", 
it will be parsed as false.

Fifth option: Case of the String parameter does not matter. As long as the String equals "true" after 
ignoring the case, it will be parsed as true.  However, if you have extra spaces, for example, " true" 
or "true ", it will be parsed as false.
