1. java.time.LocalDate.parse("2015-01-02");

To create an instance of LocalDateTime, you need to use the methods in LocalDateTime class. 
Methods in LocalDate class create LocalDate instances. Similarly, methods in LocalTime class create LocalTime instances.

2. java.time.LocalDateTime.parse("2015-01-02");
LocalDateTime requires date as well as time. 
Here, you just have a date in the input so it will throw a java.time.format.DateTimeParseException.
java.time.LocalDateTime.parse("2015-01-02T17:13:50"); would be valid.
