There is a subtle difference between: int[] i; and int i[]; although in both the cases, i is an array of integers.
The difference is if you declare multiple variables in the same statement such as: int[] i, j; and int i[], j;, 
j is not of the same type in the two cases.

In the first case, j is an array of integers while in the second case, j is just an integer.

Therefore, in this question:
array1 is an array of int
array2, array3, array4, and array5  are arrays of int arrays

Therefore, option 1, 2 and 5 are valid.
